Hello! This is the guide about my two research projects: a study about Universal Basic Income (UBI) and its effects on crime rates; 
and a data analysis & policy advising paper about a NYC community with deviant infectious data of COVID-19 in early 2020. 
They are accomplished with my acknowledgement to Prof. Daniel Kapust and Prof. Christopher McKelvey & Omer Arain, respectively.

If you are interested in the UBI study, you can get the paper at [Writing Sample-UBI study](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample-UBI%20and%20Crime%20Rate.pdf).

If you are interested in the Data Analysis projects about NYC COVID-19, you can get the report at 
[EconEX Report](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample-EconEX%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
and the slides at [EconEX Slides](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample%20-%20EconEX%20Han%20Jiang%20Slides.pdf).

## EconEX: Data Analysis

About the EconEX project:

>After learning that many summer internship programs were cancelled due to COVID-19, the Economics
>Department developed project ideas in collaboration with alumni and recruited alumni and
>faculty to serve as mentors so our students can explore potential careers and build skills for future jobs and
>internships. The goal of the program is to offer structured, professional learning opportunities for economics
>students to build marketable skills, knowledge, and experience under mentorship and guidance.

About my data analysis project: *COVID-19 Early Outbreak in NYC: Factors in High Community Infection Rate*

The main focus is on a neighborhood called `Corona`. Despite the unfortunate coincidence of name with the Coronavirus, Corona has the 7th highest infection rate per capita among other areas in New York City, as well as a relatively high death rate. The demogrpahic information by race made this area noticeable, which also drew attention from the press such as the Guardian ([Corona in Corona](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/coronavirus-corona-queens-ny-virus-shook-neighborhood)).

I spotted Corona by both sources from the press and data visualization. By comparing the distribution of ethnic minority and COVID-19 data, it indicated that non-white community had high rates of death, infection and hospitalization.

COVID-19 data by ZIP code

argue that the contributors of this pandemic are not race but poverty, reliance on public transportation, lack of health insurance for employed labor, and community- wise inequality.

• Performed data visualization methods to estimate the impact from COVID-19 to NYC
• Developed OLS regression models to verify factors of certain high community case rates
based on independent research with methods like IV, DID and Partialling-out 
• Provided data analysis and a policy alternative matrix for NYC government










Thank you for your consideration in my application!
