Writing samples &amp; projects for graduate school application

Hello! This is the guide about my two research projects: a study about Universal Basic Income (UBI) and its effects on crime rates; and a data analysis & policy advising 
paper about a NYC community with deviant infectious data of COVID-19 in early 2020. They are supervised by Prof. Daniel Kapust and Prof. Christopher McKelvey, respectively.

If you are interested in the UBI study, you can get the paper at [Writing Sample-UBI study](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample-UBI%20and%20Crime%20Rate.pdf).

If you are interested in the Data Analysis projects about NYC COVID-19, you can get the report at 
[EconEX Report](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample-EconEX%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
and the slides at [EconEX Slides](https://github.com/hjiangAnthony/Projects-for-Graduate-School/blob/main/Writing%20Sample%20-%20EconEX%20Han%20Jiang%20Slides.pdf).

## EconEX: Data Analysis

About the EconEX project:

After learning that many summer internship programs were cancelled due to COVID-19, the Economics
Department developed project ideas in collaboration with alumni and recruited alumni and
faculty to serve as mentors so our students can explore potential careers and build skills for future jobs and
internships. The goal of the program is to offer structured, professional learning opportunities for economics
students to build marketable skills, knowledge, and experience under mentorship and guidance.
















Thank you for your consideration in my application!
